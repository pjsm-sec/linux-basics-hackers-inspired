# Linux Basics for Hackers â€“ Scripts and Notes

This repository contains Bash scripts and study notes inspired by the book **Linux Basics for Hackers** by OccupyTheWeb.

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to practice Linux command line skills and Bash scripting in an educational and ethical way. All scripts have been adapted and created based on concepts learned from the book, with original modifications.

## Usage

These scripts are intended for learning purposes only. You can run them on Linux or macOS terminals with Bash.

## How to Run the Scripts

Before running any script, make sure to give it execute permissions by changing its owner:

```bash
chmod 775 script-name.sh
```
